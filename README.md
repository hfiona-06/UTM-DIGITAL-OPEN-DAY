# UTM-DIGITAL-OPEN-DAY

On 28 October 2025, I had the opportunity to attend the UTM Digital Open Day, which was held at UTM Digital (D07), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru. The event aimed to expose students to UTM’s digital objectives, including its enterprise systems, initiatives, and technology-driven solutions that support the university’s operations.

One of the main sessions I attended was a sharing session by an Oracle representative, Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zin, titled “Oracle Academy.” The session took place at Bilik Ruckus, Level 2 (Lobby) from 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. During the talk, he clearly explained the fundamentals of Oracle systems, their applications in managing large-scale data and enterprise environments, and their significance in today’s digital industry. He also shared valuable insights into academic pathways related to Oracle technologies, as well as potential career opportunities for students interested in enterprise technology and database systems.

In addition to the talk, we were given the opportunity to visit several exhibition booths showcasing various digital services and systems developed and managed by UTM Digital. These exhibitions provided a clearer understanding of how technology is implemented within the university to improve efficiency, accessibility, and overall user experience.

Furthermore, our group conducted an interview with a UTM Digital staff member, which allowed us to gain deeper insights into the UTMSmart platform. Through the interview, we learned how UTMSmart functions as a smart campus solution by integrating various digital features to support students and staff at UTM. We were also introduced to several new and upcoming features, demonstrating UTM’s strong commitment to continuous digital innovation and smart campus development.

In conclusion, participating in the UTM Digital Open Day was a highly informative, engaging, and enriching experience. The event not only enhanced my understanding of enterprise systems such as Oracle, but also provided valuable exposure to real-world digital applications used within a large institution. This experience has further strengthened my interest in technology and motivated me to explore more opportunities related to digital systems and information technology in the future.
